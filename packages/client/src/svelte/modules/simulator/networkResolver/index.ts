 * @notice The function subscribes to changes in the block number. When a block number change is detected, the function checks the state of the player and the network's resolution. If the player has been spawned and there's a discrepancy between the last on-chain resolution and the local resolution, the function resolves the output and updates the local resolution.
 * @see {@link blockNumber} For the observable representing block number changes.
 * @see {@link playerCore} For the state of the player.
 * @see {@link playerBox} For the last resolved state on-chain.
 * @see {@link localResolved} For the local resolution state.
 * @see {@link patches} For applying patches or updates to the state.
